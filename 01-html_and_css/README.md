# Act 1 - HTML and CSS

`npm run act1`

Implement the UI (user interface) for a character stats screen.

1. This screen must be composed of at least 5 stats. For example: Vitality, Energy, Intelligence, Strength and Dexterity
2. Each stat must have an increment and a decrement button. (they don't need to work yet, but you might want to think of the disabled state styles now)
3. You must use a **repeating** background image in this page

Here's an example UI you can imitate. Feel free to be creative and make it your own!

What's expected in terms of HTML & CSS features you use:
- Use of the `<button>` tag
- Good use of `<ul>` or `<ol>` and `<li>`
- Expects to have a background image smaller than it's box size so that you can make it repeat appropriately
